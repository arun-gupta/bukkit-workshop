Starting a new Bukkit plugin
============================
This plugin template has everything you need to create a new plugin project. To start a new project, follow these steps:

1. Copy this directory and open pom.xml in your IDE.
2. Update the `<groupId>` and `<artifactId>` sections of pom.xml with your name and your plugin's name.
3. Change the package name for the `MyPlugin` class to reflect your name and your plugin's name.
4. Update plugin.yml with your plugin's name, your name, and the package for the `MyPlugin` class.

Files in this template
======================
* _PluginMain.java_ - This is the file Bukkit executes to run your plugin.
* _plugin.yml_ - This file tells Bukkit about the contents of your file and where to find PluginMain.java.
* _pom.xml_ - Tells Apache Maven how to build your plugin and where to find its dependencies.
