Starting a new Bukkit plugin
============================
This plugin template has everything you need to create a new plugin project. To start a new project, follow these steps:

1. Copy this directory and open pom.xml in your IDE.
2. Update the `<groupId>` and `<artifactId>` sections of pom.xml with your name and your plugin's name.
3. Change the package name for the `PluginMain` class to reflect your name and your plugin's name.
4. Update config.yml with your name, your plugin's name, and the package for the `PluginMain` class.
5. Add code to `PluginMain` to implement your plugin.

Files in this template

* _PluginMain.java_ - This is the file Bukkit executes to run your plugin.
* _plugin.yml_ - This file tells Bukkit about the contents of your file and where to find PluginMain.java.
* _config.yml_ - This file contains any user editable settings for your plugin.
