Getting started with Bukkit
===========================
1. Download and install the [Java runtime environment](https://www.java.com/en/), if you don't already have it installed.
2. Download the [craftbukkit server jar file](http://dl.bukkit.org/latest-beta/craftbukkit-beta.jar) from the Bukkit download site.
3. Create a directory on your desktop called `bukkit`. Move the craftbukkit jar file into the new directory.
4. Using the terminal, navigate to your bukkit directory.
5. Execute `java -jar craftbukkit-1.7.2-R0.2.jar`. Bukkit will start and generate the initial map chunks.
6. Open Minecraft and connect to a multiplayer server with the name `localhost`.
7. You are now playing Minecraft on your local Bukkit server.

Installing plugins
==================
1. Stop the server if it is running.
2. Place the plugin .jar file into the `plugins` directory.
3. Start the server.
